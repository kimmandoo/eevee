# Troubleshooting

### [2026-10-12] A named-pipe asset blocked startup before the first frame

- **Context / Symptom:** A real PTY launch with `133.png` as a FIFO stayed alive with zero startup output while no writer existed.
- **Root Cause:** Opening the path with a blocking `File::open` happened before checking the opened handle's regular-file metadata. Decode/read byte limits cannot bound a wait inside `open`.
- **Solution:** On Unix, open assets/manifests with `O_NONBLOCK`, then reject every nonregular handle before reading. The opened-handle check also covers path replacement races; ordinary PNG reads retain their byte limits. Added an isolated FIFO regression with no writer.
- **Prevention / Reference:** File-type checks must not themselves require an unbounded open; validate both the I/O boundary and the decoder boundary.

### [2026-10-12] Native image payload width skipped the remaining TUI

- **Context / Symptom:** In real Ghostty 1.3.1, the initial portrait and nine-image picker drew only the rows preceding the first image; later controls were missing and the old workspace remained visible behind the picker.
- **Root Cause:** `ratatui-image` 11.0.0 stored an entire escaped Kitty row, including base64 transmission, in one buffer cell. `ratatui-core` 0.1.2 measured that symbol as ordinary visible text and advanced its diff iterator past subsequent controls. An idle process sample showed the app waiting for input, ruling out a blocked image writer.
- **Solution:** After rendering each native image, set `CellDiffOption::ForcedWidth` on each encoded row's first cell to its physical image width. Keep the library's trailing-cell skip directives. Verified all nine native portraits and the complete picker in the real terminal; added a regression covering adjacent/later text and image removal.
- **Prevention / Reference:** Escape payload byte/display width is not terminal-cell geometry. Recheck the adapter when either pinned Ratatui or image dependency changes; text-only PTYs cannot qualify pixel rendering.

### [2026-10-12] Native VT Backspace arrived as Ctrl+H

- **Context / Symptom:** The real PTY editor smoke failed with `backspace split a combining grapheme`: sending the VT BS byte left the `café` draft unchanged.
- **Root Cause:** Crossterm represented BS as `Char('h')` with Control rather than `KeyCode::Backspace`; the modal editor intentionally ignored control shortcuts. Other terminals send DEL for Backspace.
- **Solution:** Normalize Ctrl+H to the existing grapheme-aware Backspace handler inside the editor only. Kept Control shortcuts suppressed elsewhere; verified the PTY scenario and added a combining-grapheme regression. Added Ctrl+N as a portable newline key because some terminals cannot distinguish Shift+Enter from Enter.
- **Prevention / Reference:** Exercise actual VT/ConPTY byte input in addition to reducer key-event tests.

### [2026-10-12] GUI verification required native Ghostty scripting

- **Context / Symptom:** System Events automation returned `osascript is not allowed assistive access. (-25211)`. `ghostty +new-window` was unsupported on macOS, and tab changes invalidated earlier CoreGraphics window IDs.
- **Root Cause:** GUI accessibility automation was not authorized, and the CLI action was not the macOS window-creation interface. Capturing an old window ID produced stale surfaces rather than the running app.
- **Solution:** Used Ghostty's own scripting dictionary to create isolated verification windows, activate their exact terminal IDs, and send terminal actions without changing accessibility permissions. Looked up the current CoreGraphics window ID by the dedicated verification title before each capture.
- **Prevention / Reference:** Capture only the dedicated app surface and qualify actual terminal/version behavior; do not infer a rendering failure from an inactive sibling tab or stale window snapshot.

### [2026-10-12] Fullscreen startup waited for a cursor-position reply

- **Context / Symptom:** The first real PTY launch exited with `eevee: The cursor position could not be read within a normal duration` before drawing the workspace.
- **Root Cause:** Ratatui 0.30.2 resolved to ratatui-core 0.1.2, whose `Terminal::clear()` first queries and then preserves the existing cursor position. A plain PTY automation driver does not answer the device-status request. Preserving that cursor is unnecessary for a newly entered fullscreen alternate buffer, and the query also introduces an avoidable terminal round trip.
- **Solution:** In `src/terminal.rs`, clear the new backend directly and explicitly set the cursor to `(0, 0)` before the first draw. Keep failures visible and restore terminal modes; do not catch and ignore a cursor timeout. Rebuilt and launched the actual TUI successfully without a cursor-query responder.
- **Prevention / Reference:** For fullscreen initialization, use `Backend::clear()` plus explicit cursor positioning rather than cursor-preserving `Terminal::clear()`. The real PTY lifecycle probes verified no `ESC[6n` request and verified normal/error/panic restoration. This choice is specific to a new fullscreen buffer, not an inline viewport with existing content.

### [2026-10-12] macOS PTY cleanup checks needed a supervising session

- **Context / Symptom:** Reading the slave terminal attributes after its controlling session exited raised `termios.error: (25, 'Inappropriate ioctl for device')`. Fast-exit lifecycle probes also differed only in the terminal's `PENDIN` flag; a probe that waited without draining output timed out. Pyte's display conversion raised `IndexError: string index out of range` after overwriting wide-character continuation cells during a resize/edit sequence.
- **Root Cause:** macOS revokes the controlling PTY when its session leader exits. `PENDIN` is a kernel-managed pending-input flag rather than a user-facing raw/canonical mode. A PTY has bounded output capacity. The installed Pyte display helper did not tolerate retained empty continuation cells after a wide glyph was overwritten.
- **Solution:** The throwaway smoke driver kept a supervising process as the session leader, captured terminal attributes immediately after the application returned, and compared all attributes except `PENDIN`. It drained output while waiting and treated orphan empty continuation cells as blank when exporting the emulated display; valid wide-character continuations stayed zero-width. Normal exit, returned I/O error, and panic restored the terminal, including cursor visibility, bracketed paste, and alternate-screen state. Panic diagnostics appeared after leaving the alternate screen.
- **Prevention / Reference:** Keep application behavior separate from terminal-emulator behavior. Exercise real subprocesses, consume PTY output concurrently, and capture restoration before closing the controlling session. Screen images under `target/smoke/` are rasterized captures of real PTY output, not screenshots of a separate GUI terminal. The temporary lifecycle probe source was removed after verification.

### [2026-10-12] Themed SVG preview was not visually inspectable

- **Context / Symptom:** The static image preview of `docs/TUI_MOCKUP.svg` appeared entirely black/invisible, so it could not be used to assess the updated composition.
- **Root Cause:** The SVG uses CSS theme variables and `currentColor`; the standalone preview did not produce usable contrast. The exact preview-renderer cause was not established, and this was not an application TUI failure.
- **Solution:** Rendered the same SVG inside Chromium with explicit inherited theme variables, then overlaid the actual-source Eevee PNG and displayed all nine species images in a separate picker study. Inspected the resulting composition, confirmed all ten displayed images loaded, and checked SVG text bounds. Reported the static preview mismatch to the tool issue reporter.
- **Prevention / Reference:** Validate theme-dependent design assets in a theme-aware renderer rather than treating an unusable converter image as evidence of an application bug. `target/design-artwork/sanctuary-preview.png` is a local concept preview, not native terminal graphics verification or a checked-in franchise asset.
